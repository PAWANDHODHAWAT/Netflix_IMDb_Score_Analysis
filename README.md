Business Problem - 
                One of the key challenges for streaming platforms like Netflix is acquiring content that appeals to a wide range of audiences and maximizes viewership.
                To address this challenge, Netflix wants to analyze the IMDb scores of its content based on genres and understand which genres have higher average ratings.
